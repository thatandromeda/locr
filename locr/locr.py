    Fetcher(result).full_text():
        Given the JSON representation of a single item, find its full text.

    OCRed text is stored on different servers with different URL formats, and
    the full text URL is not usually part of the search result, so there is no
    one single pattern for finding the OCR URL. Fetcher is actually responsible
    for identifying which of several handlers is most likely to succeed for this
    item, and delegating to its full_text() method.

    There are no guarantees about OCR quality; some texts may be unsuitable for
    some purposes. The caller is responsible for assessing quality.

    While Fetcher makes a good-faith attempt to respect rate limiting,
    intermittent server failures mean that text will not always be fetched even
    if it exists.
